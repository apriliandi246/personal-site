<h1 class="title">The phenomenon of "SHOULD I LEARN"</h1>

<span class="date">2021-02-25</span>

<p>
   Maybe you think with this blog title, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PHENOMENON".
   Yes, that's not wrong but many people do this phenomenon all the time. For
   example, if a new Javascript framework or library comes out and programmers
   in some groups or some forum say "SHOULD I LEARN THIS".
</p>

<p>
   If you just use that new framework or library just because it's very trending
   and a lot of people talk about it, I think why not change your perspective
   about this phenomenon. For example, why not try to visit the documentation
   and read about that framework or library. If you have time, find out why the
   author of the framework or library makes this thing, what problem the author
   solves, or even the philosophy behind this framework or library.
</p>

<p>
   For example, when I wanna learn another Javascript frontend framework, and
   that framework gives me a lot of productivity and the performance is also
   very good. Finally, I decided to choose Svelte, and Svelte solve my problem
   about productivity and performance.
</p>

<p>
   On the productivity side, Svelte gives me a lot of productivity while I am
   coding. For example, Svelte has a lot of features, for example, built-in
   transition, animation, state management, and more. Even Svelte give me some
   useful utilities that help me a lot, for example, scoped style, unused CSS
   code, and more.
</p>

<p>
   On the performant side, Svelte is not inferior to other Javascript frontend
   frameworks or even Svelte has better performance in some situations. And I'm
   also doing research on why Rich Harris (Svelte's author) makes Svelte, what
   problem he solves, and more.
</p>

<p>Yeahh, that is what I think about this phenomenon.... Thanks</p>
